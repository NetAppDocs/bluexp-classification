BlueXP classification does not impose a limit on the amount of data it can scan; however, only 500 TiB of data can be scanned per Connector. To scan more than 500 TiB of data, link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html#connector-installation[install another Connector^]. For tips on managing different Connectors, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-manage-multiple-connectors.html#switch-between-connectors[Work with multiple Connectors^].
