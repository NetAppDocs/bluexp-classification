When BlueXP classification is deployed in the cloud, you need to SSH to the BlueXP classification instance. You SSH to the system by entering the user and password, or by using the SSH key you provided during the BlueXP Connector installation. The SSH command is:

 ssh -i <path_to_the_ssh_key> <machine_user>@<datasense_ip>

* <path_to_the_ssh_key> = location of ssh authentication keys
* <machine_user>:

** For AWS: use the <ec2-user>
** For Azure: use the user created for the BlueXP instance
** For GCP: use the user created for the BlueXP instance

* <datasense_ip> = IP address of the virtual machine instance

Note that you'll need to modify the security group inbound rules to access the system in the cloud. For details, see:
