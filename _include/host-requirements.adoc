* BlueXP classification is not supported on a host that is shared with other applications - the host must be a dedicated host.

* When building the host system in your premises, you can choose among three system sizes depending on the size of the data set that you plan to have BlueXP classification scan.

|===
| System size
| CPU
| RAM (swap memory must be disabled)
| Disk
| *Large* | 16 CPUs | 64 GB RAM | 500 GiB SSD on /, or
- 100 GiB available on /opt
- 395 GiB available on /var/lib/docker
- 5 GiB on /tmp

- 50 GiB available on /opt
- 145 GiB available on /var/lib/docker
- 5 GiB on /tmp
| *Small* | 8 CPUs | 16 GB RAM | 100 GiB SSD on /, or
- 50 GiB available on /opt
- 45 GiB available on /var/lib/docker
- 5 GiB on /tmp

Note that there are limitations when using these smaller systems. See link:concept-cloud-compliance.html#using-a-smaller-instance-type[Using a smaller instance type] for details.

* When deploying a compute instance in the cloud for your BlueXP classification installation, we recommend a system that meets the "Large" system requirements above:

** *AWS EC2 instance type*: We recommend "m6i.4xlarge". link:reference-instance-types.html#aws-instance-types[See additional AWS instance types^]. 
** *Azure VM size*: We recommend "Standard_D16s_v3". link:reference-instance-types.html#azure-instance-types[See additional Azure instance types^].
** *GCP machine type*: We recommend "n2-standard-16". link:reference-instance-types.html#gcp-instance-types[See additional GCP instance types^].

* *UNIX folder permissions*: The following minimum UNIX permissions are required:
+
[cols="25,25",width=60%,options="header"]
|===
| Folder
| Minimum Permissions

| /tmp | `rwxrwxrwt`

| /opt | `rwxr-xr-x`

| /var/lib/docker | `rwx------`

| /usr/lib/systemd/system  | `rwxr-xr-x`
|===

* *Operating system*: 

** The following operating systems require using the Docker container engine:

*** Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7.8 and 7.9
*** CentOS version 7.8 and 7.9
//*** Rocky Linux 9 (requires BlueXP classification version 1.24 or greater)
*** Ubuntu 22.04 (requires BlueXP classification version 1.23 or greater)

** The following operating systems require using the Podman container engine, and they require BlueXP classification version 1.26 or greater:

*** Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 9.0, 9.1, and 9.2
+
Note that the following features are not currently supported when using RHEL 9.x:
+
**** Installation in a dark site
**** Distributed scanning; using a master scanner node and remote scanner nodes

* *Red Hat Subscription Management*: The host must be registered with Red Hat Subscription Management. If it's not registered, the system can't access repositories to update required 3rd-party software during installation.

* *Additional software*: You must install the following software on the host before you install BlueXP classification:

** Depending on the OS you are using, you'll need to install one of the container engines:
+
*** Docker Engine version 19.3.1 or greater. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[View installation instructions^].
+
https://youtu.be/Ogoufel1q6c[Watch this video^] for a quick demo of installing Docker on CentOS.
*** Podman version 4 or greater. To install Podman, update your system packages (`sudo yum update -y`), and then install Podman (`sudo yum install podman -y`).
//https://podman.io/docs/installation#installing-on-linux[View installation instructions^].

** Python version 3.6 or greater. https://www.python.org/downloads/[View installation instructions^].

* *NTP considerations*: NetApp recommends configuring the BlueXP classification system to use a Network Time Protocol (NTP) service. The time must be synchronized between the BlueXP classification system and the BlueXP connector system.
