If you want to make sure your files “last accessed times” are unchanged by BlueXP classification classification scans, we recommend that the user has Write Attributes permissions in CIFS or write permissions in NFS. If possible, we recommend making the Active Directory configured user part of a parent group in the organization which has permissions to all files.
