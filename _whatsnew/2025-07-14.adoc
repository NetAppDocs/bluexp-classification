=== Version 1.45

This BlueXP classification release includes code changes that optimize resource utilization and:

.Improved workflow to add file shares for scanning

The process to add file shares to a group for scanning has been improved and simplified. 
The process now supports more granular authentication, with Kerberos and NTLM options for the CIFS protocol. 

For more information, see xref:task-scanning-file-share.html[Scan file shares].

.Enhanced file owner information

You can now view more information about file owners for files captured in the Investigation tab. When viewing metadata for a file in the Investigation tab, locate the File owner then select **View details** to see the username, email, and SAM account name. You can also view other items owned by this user. This feature is only available if you've configured Active Directory.
