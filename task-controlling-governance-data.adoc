Gain control of the costs related to the data on your organizations' storage resources. BlueXP classification identifies the amount of stale data, non-business data, duplicate files, and very large files in your systems so you can decide whether you want to remove or tier some files to less expensive object storage.

This is where you should begin your research. From the Governance dashboard, you can select an area for further investigation.

Additionally, if you're planning to migrate data from on-premises locations to the cloud, you can view the size of the data and whether any of the data contains sensitive information before moving it.

== Review the Governance dashboard

The Governance dashboard provides information so that you can increase the efficiency and control the costs related to the data stored on your storage resources.

** Application Data
** Audio
** Executables
** Images
** Logs
** Videos
** Miscellaneous (general "other" category)

* *Duplicate Files* - Files that are duplicated in other locations in the data sources you are scanning. link:task-investigate-data.html#filter-data-by-duplicates[See what types of duplicate files are displayed].

NOTE: If any of your data sources implement data tiering, old data that already resides in object storage can be identified in the _Stale Data_ category.

=== Review policies with the largest number of results

In the _Policies_ area, the policies with the greatest number of results appear at the top of the list. 

.Steps 


. From the BlueXP classification menu, select *Governance*.

For details about policies, see link:task-using-policies.html[Assign policies to your data].


== Create the Data Discovery Assessment Report

The Data Discovery Assessment Report provides a high-level analysis of the scanned environment to show areas of concern and potential remediation steps. The results are based on both mapping and classifying your data. The goal of this report is to raise awareness of three significant aspects of your dataset:

[cols="25,65",width=90%,options="header"]
|===
| Feature
| Description
| Data governance concerns | A detailed picture of all the data you own and areas where you may be able to reduce the amount of data to save costs.
| Data security exposures | Areas where your data is accessible to internal or external attacks because of broad access permissions.
| Data compliance gaps | Where your personal or sensitive personal information is located for both security and for DSARs (data subject access requests).
|===

Using this report, you might take the following actions:

* Reduce storage costs by changing your retention policy, or by moving or deleting certain data (stale, duplicate, or non-business data)
* Protect your data that has broad permissions by revising global group management policies
* Protect your data that has personal or sensitive personal information by moving PII to more secure data stores



.Steps

. From the BlueXP menu, select *Governance > Classification*.

. Select *Governance*.
. Select the *Data Discovery Assessment Report* button.

.Result

BlueXP classification generates a .pdf report that you can review and send to other groups as needed.

//Note that you can customize the company name that appears on the first page of the report from the top of the BlueXP classification page by clicking image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[the More button] and then clicking *Change company name*. The next time you generate the report it will include the new name.

== Create the Data Mapping Overview Report

The Data Mapping Overview Report provides an overview of the data being stored in your corporate data sources to assist you with decisions of migration, back up, security, and compliance processes. The report first lists an overview that summarizes all your working environments and data sources, and then it provides an analysis for each working environment.


The report includes the following information:

[cols="25,65",width=90%,options="header"]
|===
| Category
| Description
| Usage Capacity | For all working environments: Lists the number of files and the used capacity for each working environment.
For single working environments: Lists the files that are using the most capacity.
| Age of Data | Provides three charts and graphs for when files were created, last modified, or last accessed. Lists the number of files, and their used capacity, based on certain date ranges.
| Size of Data | Lists the number of files that exist within certain size ranges in your working environments.
| File Types | Lists the total number of files and the used capacity for each type of file being stored in your working environments.
|===


.Steps

. From the BlueXP menu, select *Governance > Classification*.

. Select *Governance*.
. Select *Full Data Mapping Overview Report*.

. To customize the company name that appears on the first page of the report, from the top right of the BlueXP classification page select image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[the More button]. Then select *Change company name*. The next time you generate the report, it will include the new name.


.Result

BlueXP classification generates a .pdf report that you can review and send to other groups as needed.

If the report is larger than 1 MB, the .pdf file is retained on the BlueXP classification instance and you'll see a pop-up message about the exact location. When BlueXP classification is installed on a Linux machine on your premises, or on a Linux machine you deployed in the cloud, you can navigate directly to the .pdf file. When BlueXP classification is deployed in the cloud, you'll need to SSH to the BlueXP classification instance to download .pdf file. link:task-audit-data-sense-actions.html#access-the-log-files[See how to access data on the Classification instance^].




=== Review the top data repositories listed by data sensitivity

The _Top Data Repositories by Sensitivity Level_ area lists the top four data repositories (working environments and data sources) that contain the most sensitive items. The bar chart for each working environment is divided into:

* Non-Sensitive data
* Personal data
* Sensitive Personal data

.Steps

. To see the total number of items in each category, position your cursor over each section of the bar.

. To filter results that will appear in the Investigation page, select each area ib the bar and investigate further.

=== Review sensitive data and wide permissions

The _Sensitive Data and Wide Permissions_ area shows the percentage of files that contain sensitive data and have wide permissions. The chart shows the following types of permissions: 

* From the nost restrictive permissions to the most permissive restrictions on the horizontal axix. 
* From the least sensitve data to the most sensitive data on the vertical axis.

.Steps
. To see the total number of files in each category, position your cursor over each box. 

. To filter results that will appear in the Investigation page, select a box and investigate further.


=== Review data listed by types of open permissions

The _Open Permissions_ area shows the percentage for each type of permissions that exist for all files that are being scanned. The chart shows the following types of permissions:

* No Open Permissions
* Open to Organization
* Open to Public
* Unknown Access

.Steps 

. To see the total number of files in each category, position your cursor over each box. 

. To filter results that will appear in the Investigation page, select a box and investigate further.

=== Review the age and size of data

You might want to investigate the items in the _Age_ and _Size_ graphs to see if there is any data you should delete or tier to less expensive object storage.

.Steps

. In the Age of Data chart, to see details about the age of the data, position your cursor over a point in the chart. 

. To filter by an age or size range, select that age or size.

* *Age of Data graph* - Categorizes data based on the time it was created, the last time it was accessed, or the last time it was modified.
* *Size of Data graph* - Categorizes data based on size.

NOTE: If any of your data sources implement data tiering, old data that already resides in object storage might be identified in the _Age of Data_ graph.

=== Review the most identified data classifications in your data

The _Classification_ area provides a list of the most identified link:task-controlling-private-data.html#view-files-by-categories[Categories^] and link:task-controlling-private-data.html#view-files-by-file-types[File types^] in your scanned data.

Categories can help you understand what's happening with your data by showing you the types of information that you have. For example, a category like "resumes" or "employee contracts" can include sensitive data. When you investigate the results, you might find that employee contracts are stored in a nonsecure location. You can then correct that issue.

See link:task-controlling-private-data.html#view-files-by-categories[Viewing files by categories^] for more information.
