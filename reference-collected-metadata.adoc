Data Sense collects certain metadata when performing classification scans on the data from your data sources and working environments. Data Sense can access most of the metadata we need to classify your data, but there are some sources where we are unable to access the data we need.

|===
|  | *Metadata* | *CIFS* | *NFS*

.3+| *Time stamps* 
| *Creation time* | Available | Not available (Unsupported in Linux)

| *Last access time* | Available | Available
 
| *Last modify time* | Available | Available

.2+| *Permissions* 
| *Open permissions* | If "EVERYONE" group has access to the file, it is considered "Open to organization" | If "Others" has access to the file, it is considered "Open to organization"

| *Users/group access* | Users and group information is taken from LDAP | Not available (NFS users are usually managed locally on the server, therefore, the same individual can have a different UID in each server)

== Last access time timestamp

When Data Sense extracts data from file shares, the operating system considers it as accessing the data and it changes the "last access time" accordingly. After scanning, Data Sense attempts to revert the last access time to the original timestamp. If Data Sense doesn't have write attributes permissions in CIFS, or write permissions in NFS, the system can't revert the last access time to the original timestamp.

By default, if Data Sense doesn't have these permissions, the system won't scan the files in your volumes because Data Sense can't revert the "last access time" to the original timestamp. However, if you don't care if the last access time is reset to the original time in your files, you can click the *Scan when missing "write attributes" permissions* switch at the bottom of the Configuration page so that Data Sense will scan the volumes regardless of permissions.

This functionality is applicable to On-premises ONTAP systems, Cloud Volumes ONTAP, Azure NetApp Files, FSx for ONTAP, and Non-NetApp file shares.

Note that there is a filter _Scan Analysis Event_ that enables you to display in the Investigation page the files that were not classified because Data Sense can't revert the last accessed time.
