Data Sense collects certain metadata when performing classification scans on the data from your data sources and working environments. Data Sense can access most of the metadata we need to classify your data, but there are some sources where we are unable to access the data we need.

== Last access time timestamp

When Data Sense extracts data from file shares, the operating system considers it as accessing the data and it changes the "last access time" accordingly. After scanning, Data Sense attempts to revert the last access time to the original timestamp. If Data Sense doesn't have write attributes permissions in CIFS, or write permissions in NFS, the system can't revert the last access time to the original timestamp. ONTAP volumes configured with SnapLock have read-only permissions and also can't revert the last access time to the original timestamp. 

By default, if Data Sense doesn't have these permissions, the system won't scan those files in your volumes because Data Sense can't revert the "last access time" to the original timestamp. However, if you don't care if the last access time is reset to the original time in your files, you can click the *Scan when missing "write attributes" permissions* switch at the bottom of the Configuration page so that Data Sense will scan the volumes regardless of permissions.

This functionality is applicable to On-premises ONTAP systems, Cloud Volumes ONTAP, Azure NetApp Files, FSx for ONTAP, and Non-NetApp file shares.

Note that there is a filter in the Investigation page called _Scan Analysis Event_ that enables you to display either the files that were not classified because Data Sense couldn't revert the last accessed time, or the files that were classified even though Data Sense couldn't revert the last access time.

The filter selections are:

* "Not classified -- Cannot revert last access time" - This shows the files that were not classified due to missing write permissions.
* "Classified and updated last access time" - This shows the files that were classified and Data Sense was unable to reset the last access time back to the original date. This filter is relevant only for environments where you turned *Scan when missing "write attributes" permissions* ON. 

If needed, you can export these results to a report so you can see which files are, or aren't, being scanned because of permissions. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-data-sense/task-investigate-data.html#data-investigation-report[Learn more about the Data Investigation Report^].
