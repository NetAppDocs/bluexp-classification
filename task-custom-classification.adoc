With BlueXP classification, you can create a custom search for sensitive information. The search can be scoped to a regular expression or a set of proximity keywords. 

== Create a custom classificaiton 

// You must have created a working environment to enable a custom classification. 
// Custom classification is only available for Map & Classify scans, not mapping-only scans. 
// This feature is currently in preview. 

.Steps
. Select the **Custom classification** tab. 
. Select the **Add New Classifier**.
. Add Name and Description for the new classifier. 
. To add the customization as a regular expression, select **Custom regular expression** then  **Next**. 

.. For a regular expression, add the pattern to detect the specific information of your data. For example, 12-digit ID beginning with 201 would be \b201\f\d(9)b. Select **Validate** to confirm your the syntax of your entry. 

The new customization is captured in the next scheduled scan. To view results, see xref:task-generating-compliance-reports.html[Generate compliance reports].
