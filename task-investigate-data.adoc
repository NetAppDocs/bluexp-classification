You can investigate the data from your organization by viewing details in the Data Investigation page. Here is where you can continue your research after looking at the Governance dashboard. On the Investigation page, you can filter the data using one of the many filters to show only the results you want to see. You can also view file metadata, permissions for files and directories, and check for duplicate files in your storage systems.

You can navigate to this page from many areas of the BlueXP classification UI, including the Governance and Compliance dashboards with the filters selected already on those pages. You can export the data into a CSV or JSON file for further analysis or to share with others.

NOTE: The capabilities described in this section are available only if you have chosen to perform a full classification scan on your data sources. Data sources that have had a mapping-only scan do not show file-level details.

== Filter data in the Data Investigation page

You can filter the contents of the investigation page to display only the results you want to see. 

.Steps 

. From the BlueXP classification menu, select *Investigation*.

. On the Data Investigation page, do any of the following: 

. To download the contents of the page as a report after you've refined it, select the image:button_download.png[download button] button. <<Data Investigation Report,Go here for details about the Data Investigation report>>.
//Note that the actions available in the button bar and Policies are not currently supported at the "Directory" level.

. To view the data from files (unstructured data), directories (folders and file shares), or from databases (structured data), select one of the tabs at the top. 

. To sort the results in numerical or alphabetical order, select the control at the top of each column.

. To refine the results even more, select one of the many filters in the left Filter pane. 

[NOTE]
You can only view the first 10,000 results—or 500 pages—for a scan on the Data Investigation page. 

*Filter data by sensitivity and content*

Use the following filters to view how much sensitive information is contained in your data. 

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,60"]

== View file metadata

In addition to showing you the working environment and volume where the file resides, the metadata shows much more information, including the file permissions, file owner, and whether there are duplicates of this file. This information is useful if you're planning to link:task-using-policies.html[create Policies] because you can see all the information that you can use to filter your data.

Not all information is available for all data sources - just what is appropriate for that data source. For example, volume name and permissions are not relevant for database files.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP classification menu, select *Investigation*.
. In the Data Investigation list on the right, select the down-caret image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] on the right for any single file to view the file metadata.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_file_details.png[A screenshot showing the metadata details for a file in the Data Investigation page.]



//When viewing the details for a single file there are a few actions you can take on the file:

//* You can move or copy the file to any NFS share. See link:task-managing-highlights.html[Moving source files to an NFS share] and link:task-managing-highlights.html[Copying source files to an NFS share] for details.

//* You can delete the file. See link:task-managing-highlights.html#delete-source-files[Deleting source files] for details.

//* You can assign a certain Status to the file. See link:task-org-private-data.html#apply-tags-to-manage-your-scanned-files[Applying tags] for details.

//* You can assign the file to a BlueXP user to be responsible for any follow-up actions that need to be done on the file. See link:task-org-private-data.html#assign-users-to-manage-certain-files[Assigning users to a file] for details.

//* If you have integrated AIP labels with BlueXP classification, you can assign a label to this file, or change to a different label if one already exists. See link:task-org-private-data.html#assign-aip-labels-manually[Assigning AIP labels manually] for details.

== View users' permissions for files and directories

To view a list of all users or groups who have access to a file or to a directory and the types of permissions they have, select *View all Permissions*. This button is available only for data in CIFS shares.

Note that if you see SIDs (Security IDentifiers) instead of user and group names, you should integrate your Active Directory into BlueXP classification. link:task-add-active-directory-datasense.html[See how to do this].

.Steps

. From the BlueXP classification menu, select *Investigation*.
. In the Data Investigation list on the right, select the down-caret image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] on the right for any single file to view the file metadata.
. To view a list of all users or groups who have access to a file or to a directory and the types of permissions they have, in the Open Permissions field, select *View all Permissions*. 
+
NOTE: BlueXP classification shows up to 100 users in the list. 
+
image:screenshot_compliance_permissions.png[A screenshot showing detailed file permissions.]
//replace screenshot with Role and Department headings using screenshot_compliance_permissions_future.png in repo

. Select the down-caret image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] button for any group to see the list of users who are part of the group.
+
TIP: You can expand one level of the group to see the users who are part of the group.

. Select the name of a user or group to refresh the Investigation page so you can see all the files and directories that the user or group has access to.

== Check for duplicate files in your storage systems

You can view if duplicate files are being stored in your storage systems. This is useful if you want to identify areas where you can save storage space. It can also be helpful to make sure certain files that have specific permissions or sensitive information are not unnecessarily duplicated in your storage systems.

All of your files (not including databases) that are 1 MB or larger, or that contain personal or sensitive personal information, are compared to see if there are duplicates. 

BlueXP classification uses hashing technology to determine duplicate files. If any file has the same hash code as another file, we can be 100% sure that the files are exact duplicates -- even if the file names are different.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP classification menu, select *Investigation*.

. In the Investigation page Filters pane on the left, select "File Size" along with "Duplicates" ("Has duplicates") to see which files of a certain size range are duplicated in your environment.

. Optionally, download the list of duplicate files and send it to your storage admin so they can decide which files, if any, can be deleted. 

. Optionally, link:task-managing-highlights.html[delete the file] yourself if you are confident that a specific version of the file is not needed.


*View if a specific file is duplicated*

You can see if a single file has duplicates. 

.Steps

. From the BlueXP classification menu, select *Investigation*.

. In the Data Investigation list, select image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] on the right for any single file to view the file metadata. 
+
If duplicates exist for a file, this information appears next to the _Duplicates_ field.

. To view the list of duplicate files and where they are located, select *View Details*. 
. In the next page select *View Duplicates* to view the files in the Investigation page.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_duplicate_file.png[A screenshot showing how to view where duplicated files are located.]
+
TIP: You can use the "file hash" value provided in this page and enter it directly in the Investigation page to search for a specific duplicate file at any time - or you can use it in a Policy.

== Create the Data Investigation Report

The Data Investigation Report is a download of the filtered contents of the Data Investigation page. 

The report is available as a .CSV or .JSON file that you can save to the local machine. 


//* As a .JSON file that you export to an NFS Share. 
//+
//If there are more than 250,000 rows of data, additional .JSON files are created. 
//+
//When exporting to a file share, make sure BlueXP classification has the correct permissions for export access.

There can be up to three report files downloaded if BlueXP classification is scanning files (unstructured data), directories (folders and file shares), and databases (structured data).

The files are split into files with a fixed number of rows or records:

* CSV - 200,000 records
* JSON - 100,000 records

*What's included in the Data Investigation Report*

The *Unstructured Files Data Report* includes the following information about your files:

* File name
* Location type
* Working environment name
* Storage repository (for example, a volume, bucket, shares)
* Repository type
* File path
* File type
* File size (in MB)
* Created time
* Last modified
* Last accessed
* File owner
* Category
* Personal information
* Sensitive personal information
* Open permissions
* Scan Analysis Error
* Deletion detection date
+
A deletion detection date identifies the date that the file was deleted or moved. This enables you to identify when sensitive files have been moved. Deleted files aren't part of the file number count that appears in the dashboard or on the Investigation page. The files only appear in the CSV reports.

The *Unstructured Directories Data Report* includes the following information about your folders and file shares:

* Working environment type
* Working environment name
* Directory name
* Storage repository (for example, a folder or file shares)
* Directory owner
* Created time
* Discovered time
* Last modified
* Last accessed
* Open permissions
* Directory type

The *Structured Data Report* includes the following information about your database tables:

* DB Table name
* Location type
* Working environment name
* Storage repository (for example, a schema)
* Column count
* Row count
* Personal information
* Sensitive personal information


.Steps to generate the report

. From the Data Investigation page, select the image:button_download.png[download button] button on the top, right of the page.
. Choose the report type: CSV or JSON.

. Provide a **Report name**. 

. Select a **Working environment** and **Volume** 

. Provide a **Destination folder path**. 
. Select **Download Report**.
//+
//When selecting a .JSON report, enter the name of the NFS share where the report will be downloaded in the format `<host_name>:/<share_path>`.
+

.Result

A dialog displays a message that the reports are being downloaded.

//You can view the progress of JSON report generation in the link:task-view-compliance-actions.html[Actions Status pane].

== Create a policy based on selected filters

It might be helpful to you to save the filters you've selected in the Data Investigation page as a policy. This way, you can run the same filters at any time without having to reselect them.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP classification menu, select *Investigation*. 
. On the Data Investigation page, select the filters you want to use to create a policy.
. At the bottom of the Filter pane, select *Create policy from this search*.
. Enter a name and a description for the policy.
. Choose any of the following: 
* *Automatically delete files that match this policy (every day): Select this if you want to delete the files that match the policy.
* *Send email updates about this policy to BlueXP users on this account every <day/week/month>*: Select this if you want to send email updates about the policy to BlueXP users on this account.
* *Send email every <Day> to <email address>*: Select this if you want to send an email every <Day> to a specific email address.

. Select *Create Policy*.

TIP: It might take up to 15 minutes for the results to appear on the Policies page.
