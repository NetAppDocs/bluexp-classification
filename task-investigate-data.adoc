You can investigate the data from your organization by viewing details in the Data Investigation page. You can navigate to this page from many areas of the BlueXP classification UI, including the Governance and Compliance dashboards.

NOTE: The capabilities described in this section are available only if you have chosen to perform a full classification scan on your data sources. Data sources that have had a mapping-only scan do not show file-level details.

== Filter data in the Data Investigation page

You can filter the contents of the investigation page to display only the results you want to see. This is a very powerful feature because after you've refined the data, you can use the button bar at the top of the page to perform a variety of actions, including copying files, moving files, adding a tag or AIP label to the files, and more.

If you want to download the contents of the page as a report after you've refined it, click the image:button_download.png[download button] button. <<Data Investigation Report,Go here for details about the Data Investigation report>>.

//Note that the actions available in the button bar and Policies are not currently supported at the "Directory" level.

image:screenshot_compliance_investigation_filtered.png[A screenshot of the filters available when refining the results in the investigation page.]

* The top-level tabs enable you to view data from files (unstructured data), directories (folders and file shares), or from databases (structured data).

* The controls at the top of each column enable you to sort the results in numerical or alphabetical order.

* The left-pane filters enable you to refine the results by selecting the attributes described in the next sections.

=== Filter data by sensitivity and content

Use the following filters to view how much sensitive information is contained in your data.

== View file metadata

In the Data Investigation results pane you can click image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] for any single file to view the file metadata.

image:screenshot_compliance_file_details.png[A screenshot showing the metadata details for a file in the Data Investigation page.]

In addition to showing you the working environment and volume where the file resides, the metadata shows much more information, including the file permissions, file owner, whether there are duplicates of this file, and assigned AIP label (if you have link:task-org-private-data.html#categorize-your-data-using-aip-labels[integrated AIP in BlueXP classification^]). This information is useful if you're planning to link:task-using-policies.html#create-custom-policies[create Policies] because you can see all the information that you can use to filter your data.

Note that not all information is available for all data sources - just what is appropriate for that data source. For example, volume name, permissions, and AIP labels are not relevant for database files.

When viewing the details for a single file there are a few actions you can take on the file:

* You can move or copy the file to any NFS share. See link:task-managing-highlights.html#move-source-files-to-an-nfs-share[Moving source files to an NFS share] and link:task-managing-highlights.html#copy-source-files[Copying source files to an NFS share] for details.

* You can delete the file. See link:task-managing-highlights.html#delete-source-files[Deleting source files] for details.

* You can assign a certain Status to the file. See link:task-org-private-data.html#apply-tags-to-manage-your-scanned-files[Applying tags] for details.

* You can assign the file to a BlueXP user to be responsible for any follow-up actions that need to be done on the file. See link:task-org-private-data.html#assign-users-to-manage-certain-files[Assigning users to a file] for details.

* If you have integrated AIP labels with BlueXP classification, you can assign a label to this file, or change to a different label if one already exists. See link:task-org-private-data.html#assign-aip-labels-manually[Assigning AIP labels manually] for details.

== View permissions for files and directories

To view a list of all users or groups who have access to a file or to a directory, and the types of permissions they have, click *View all Permissions*. This button is available only for data in CIFS shares, SharePoint Online, SharePoint On-Premise, and OneDrive.

Note that if you see SIDs (Security IDentifiers) instead of user and group names, you should integrate your Active Directory into BlueXP classification. link:task-add-active-directory-datasense.html[See how to do this].

image:screenshot_compliance_permissions.png[A screenshot showing detailed file permissions.]
//replace screenshot later with Role and Department headings using screenshot_compliance_permissions_future.png in repo

You can click image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] for any group to see the list of users who are part of the group.

Additionally, you can click the name of a user or a group and the Investigation page is displayed with the name of that user or group populated in the “User / Group Permissions” filter so you can see all the files and directories that the user or group has access to.

== Check for duplicate files in your storage systems

You can view if duplicate files are being stored in your storage systems. This is useful if you want to identify areas where you can save storage space. It can also be helpful to make sure certain files that have specific permissions or sensitive information are not unnecessarily duplicated in your storage systems.

All of your files (not including databases) that are 1 MB or larger, and that contain personal or sensitive personal information, are compared to see if there are duplicates. You can use the Investigation page filters "File Size" along with "Duplicates" to see which files of a certain size range are duplicated in your environment.

BlueXP classification uses hashing technology to determine duplicate files. If any file has the same hash code as another file, we can be 100% sure that the files are exact duplicates -- even if the file names are different.

You can download the list of duplicate files and send it to your storage admin so they can decide which files, if any, can be deleted. Or you can link:task-managing-highlights.html#delete-source-files[delete the file] yourself if you are confident that a specific version of the file is not needed.

=== View all duplicated files

If you want a list of all files that are duplicated in the working environments and data sources you are scanning, you can use the filter called *Duplicates > Has duplicates* in the Data Investigation page.

All duplicated files are displayed in the Results page.

=== View if a specific file is duplicated

If you want to see if a single file has duplicates, in the Data Investigation results pane you can click image:button_down_caret.png[down-caret] for any single file to view the file metadata. If there are duplicates of a certain file, this information appears next to the _Duplicates_ field.

To view the list of duplicate files and where they are located, click *View Details*. In the next page click *View Duplicates* to view the files in the Investigation page.

image:screenshot_compliance_duplicate_file.png[A screenshot showing how to view where duplicated files are located.]

TIP: You can use the "file hash" value provided in this page and enter it directly in the Investigation page to search for a specific duplicate file at any time - or you can use it in a Policy.

== Data Investigation Report

The Data Investigation Report is a download of the filtered contents of the Data Investigation page. 

The report is available in two different formats:

* As a .CSV file that you can save to the local machine. 
+
This report can include a maximum of 10,000 rows of data.
* As a .JSON file that you export to an NFS Share. 
+
If there are more than 250,000 rows of data, additional .JSON files are created. 
+
When exporting to a file share, make sure BlueXP classification has the correct permissions for export access.

There can be up to three report files downloaded if BlueXP classification is scanning files (unstructured data), directories (folders and file shares), and databases (structured data).

=== Generate the Data Investigation Report

.Steps

. From the Data Investigation page, click the image:button_download.png[download button] button on the top, right of the page.

. Select whether you want to download a .CSV report or .JSON report of the data, and click *Download Report*.
+
When selecting a .JSON report, enter the name of the NFS share where the report will be downloaded in the format `<host_name>:/<share_path>`.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_investigation_report.png[A screenshot of the Download Investigation Report page with multiple options.]

.Result

A dialog displays a message that the reports are being downloaded.

You can view the progress of JSON report generation in the link:task-view-compliance-actions.html[Actions Status pane].

=== What's included in each Data Investigation Report
