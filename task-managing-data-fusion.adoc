Data Sense provides many ways for you to add a custom list of "personal data" that Data Sense will identify in future scans, giving you the full picture about where potentially sensitive data resides in _all_ your organizations' files.

* You can add unique identifiers based on specific columns in databases you are scanning.
* You can add custom keywords from a text file -- these words are identified within your data.
* You can add a personal pattern using a regular expression (regex) -- the regex is added to the existing predefined patterns.

NOTE: The capabilities described in this section are available only if you have chosen to perform a full classification scan on your data sources. Data sources that have had a mapping-only scan do not show file-level details.

== Add custom personal data identifiers from your databases

A feature we call _Data Fusion_ allows you to scan your organizations' data to identify whether unique identifiers from your databases are found in any of your other data sources. You can choose the additional identifiers that Data Sense will look for in its' scans by selecting a specific column, or columns, in a database table. For example, the diagram below shows how data fusion is used to scan your volumes, buckets, and databases for occurrences of all your Customer IDs from your Oracle database.

As you can see, two unique Customer IDs have been found in two volumes and in one S3 bucket. Any matches in database tables will also be identified.

Note that since you're scanning your own databases, whatever language your data is stored in will be used to identify data in future Data Sense scans.

.Steps

You must have link:task-scanning-databases.html#adding-the-database-server[added at least one database server^] to Data Sense before you can add data fusion sources.

. In the Configuration page, click *Manage Data Fusion* in the database where the source data resides.
+

. Click *Add Data Fusion source* on the next page.

. In the _Add Data Fusion Source_ page:
.. Select the Database Schema from the drop-down menu.
.. Enter the Table name in that schema.
.. Enter the Column, or Columns, that contain the unique identifiers you want to use.
+
When adding multiple columns, enter each column name, or table view name, on a separate line.
+

. Click *Add Data Fusion Source*.
+
The Data Fusion inventory page displays the database source columns that you have configured Data Sense to scan.
+

.Results
After the next scan, the results will include this new information in the Compliance Dashboard under the "Personal Results" section, and in the Investigation page in the "Personal Data" filter. Each source column you added appears in the filter list in the format "Table.Column", for example `Customers.CustomerID`.

=== Delete a Data Fusion source

If at some point you decide not to scan your files using a certain Data Fusion source, you can select the source row from the Data Fusion inventory page and click *Delete Data Fusion Source*.

== Add custom keywords from a text file

You can add custom keywords to Data Sense so that it will identify specific information in your data. You add the keywords from a text file that you define. The keywords are added to the existing predefined keywords that Data Sense already uses, and the results will be visible under the personal patterns section. 

For example, you may want to see where internal Product Names are mentioned in all of your files to make sure these names are not accessible in locations that are not secure.

After updating the custom keywords, Data Sense will restart scanning all data sources - the new results will appear in Data Sense after the scan has completed.

You must add, or create, the text files that include the custom keywords in the following location on the Data Sense system:

 /opt/netapp/Datasense/tools/datascience/custom_keywords/keywords_sets
 
You can create a single file with multiple keywords, or you can add many files that each contain certain keywords. The format for the file is one word on each line, for example, internal Product Names which are types of owls are listed below:

_internal_product_names.txt_

 barred
 barn
 horned
 snowy
 screech

The Data Sense search for these items is not case sensitive.

Note the following requirements:

* The file name should not contain digits.
* Each file can contain a maximum of 100,000 words. If there are more words, only the first 100,000 are added.
* Each word must be at least 3 characters long. Shorter words are ignored.
* Duplicate words are only added once.

=== Accessing the command line

You'll need to access the Data Sense system in order to initiate the command to add custom keywords.

When Data Sense is installed on your premises, you can access the command line directly.

When Data Sense is deployed in the cloud, you need to SSH to the Data Sense instance. You SSH to the system by entering the user and password, or by using the SSH key you provided during the BlueXP Connector installation. The SSH command is:

 ssh -i <path_to_the_ssh_key> <machine_user>@<datasense_ip>

* <path_to_the_ssh_key> = location of ssh authentication keys
* <machine_user>:

** For AWS: use the <ec2-user>
** For Azure: use the user created for the BlueXP instance
** For GCP: use the user created for the BlueXP instance

* <datasense_ip> = IP address of the virtual machine instance

Note that you'll need to modify the security group inbound rules to access the system on the cloud. For details, see: 

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-ports-aws.html[Security group rules in AWS^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-ports-azure.html[Security group rules in Azure^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/reference-ports-gcp.html[Firewall rules in Google Cloud^]

=== Command syntax to add custom keywords

The command syntax to add custom keywords from a file is:

 sudo bash tools/datascience/custom_keywords/upload_custom_keywords.sh -s activate -f <file_name>.txt 

* <file_name> = This is the name of the file that contains the keywords.

You run the command from the path */opt/netapp/Datasense/*.

If you have created many files that contain custom keywords, you can add the keywords from all the files at once using this command:

 sudo bash tools/datascience/custom_keywords/upload_custom_keywords.sh -s activate

=== Example

To see where your internal Product Names are mentioned in all of your files, enter the following command.

[source,cli]
[user ~]$ cd /opt/netapp/Datasense/
[user Datasense]$ sudo bash tools/datascience/custom_keywords/upload_custom_keywords.sh -s activate -f internal_product_names.txt 

 log v1.0 | 2022-08-24 08:16:25,332 | INFO | ds_logger | upload_custom_keywords | 126 | 1 | None | upload_custom_keywords_126 | All legal keywords were successfully inserted

.Results
After the next scan, the results will include this new information in the Compliance Dashboard under the "Personal Results" section, and in the Investigation page in the "Personal Data" filter.

image:screenshot_add_keywords_result.png[A screenshot showing an example of custom keyword results in the Investigation Results pane.]

As you can see, the name of the text file is used as the name in the Personal Results panel. In this manner you can activate keywords from different text files and see the results for each type of keyword.

=== Deactivate custom keywords

If you decide at some later point that you don't need Data Sense to identify certain custom keywords that you previously added, use the *deactivate* option in the command to remove the keywords that are defined in the text file.

 sudo bash tools/datascience/custom_keywords/upload_custom_keywords.sh -s deactivate -f <file_name>.txt 

For example, to remove the keywords defined in the file *internal_product_names.txt*:

[source,cli]
[user ~]$ cd /opt/netapp/Datasense/
[user Datasense]$ sudo bash tools/datascience/custom_keywords/upload_custom_keywords.sh -s deactivate -f internal_product_names.txt

 log v1.0 | 2022-08-24 08:16:25,332 | INFO | ds_logger | upload_custom_keywords | 87 | 1 | None | upload_custom_keywords_87 | Deactivated keyword pattern from internal_product_names.txt successfully 

== Add custom personal data identifiers using a regex

You can add a personal pattern to identify specific information in your data using a custom regular expression (regex). The regex is added to the existing predefined patterns that Data Sense already uses, and the results will be visible under the personal patterns section. 

For example, you may want to see where your internal Product IDs are mentioned in all of your files. If the Product ID has a clear structure, for example, it is a 12-digit number that starts with 201, you can use the custom regex feature to search for it in your files.

After adding the regex, Data Sense will restart scanning all data sources - the new results will appear in Data Sense after the scan has completed.

=== Command syntax to add the regex

You'll need to access the Data Sense system in order to add the file that contains the custom keyword patterns, and to initiate the command to add the custom keywords. <<Accessing the command line,See how to access the command line>> whether you have installed Data Sense in your premises, or you have deployed it in the cloud.

The command syntax to add a custom regex is:

 sudo bash tools/datascience/custom_regex/custom_regex.sh -s activate -n "<pattern_name>" -r "<regular_expression>"

* <pattern_name> = This is the name that will appear in the Data Sense UI. Make sure the name identifies what the regex is designed to find. The name must contain at least one letter, and it can be up to 70 characters in length.
* <regular_expression> = This can be any legal regular expression.

You run the command from the path */opt/netapp/Datasense/*.

Note that we test each new regex to verify if it is too broad and it would return too many matches. If that's the case, then the following log message will appear: 

 log v1.0 | 2022-08-17 07:24:19,585 | ERROR | ds_logger | custom_regex | 119 | 1 | None | custom_regex_119 | The regex has high risk to identify false positives. Please narrow the regular expression and try again. To add it anyway, use the force flag (-f) at the end 

You can use the *-f* option at the end of the command line if you want to forcefully add the regex to Data Sense - even if we think it is too broad.

=== Example

The Product ID is a 12-digit number that starts with 201; so the regular expression is *\b201\d{9}\b*. And you want to the text in the Data Sense UI to identify this pattern as *Internal Product ID*. 

To see where your internal Product IDs are mentioned in all of your files, enter the following commands.

[source,cli]
[user ~]$ cd /opt/netapp/Datasense/
[user Datasense]$ sudo bash tools/datascience/custom_regex/custom_regex.sh -s activate -n "Internal Product ID" -r "\b201\d{9}\b"

 [+] Adding Custom Regex to Data Sense
 log v1.0 | 2022-08-23 13:19:01,476 | INFO | ds_logger | custom_regex | 154 | 1 | None | custom_regex_154 | A pattern named 'Internal Product ID' was added successfully to Data Sense

.Results
After the next scan, the results will include this new information in the Compliance Dashboard under the "Personal Results" section, and in the Investigation page in the "Personal Data" filter.

image:screenshot_add_regex_result.png[A screenshot showing an example of custom regex results in the Investigation Results pane.]

=== Deactivate a custom regex

If you decide at some later point that you don't need Data Sense to identify the custom patterns you entered as a regex, use the *deactivate* option in the command to remove each regex.

 sudo bash tools/datascience/custom_regex/custom_regex.sh -s deactivate -n "<pattern name>" 

For example, to remove the *Internal Product ID* regex:

[source,cli]
[user ~]$ cd /opt/netapp/Datasense/
[user Datasense]$ sudo bash tools/datascience/custom_regex/custom_regex.sh -s deactivate -n "Internal Product ID"

 log v1.0 | 2022-08-17 09:13:15,431 | INFO | ds_logger | custom_regex | 31 | 1 | None | custom_regex_31 | A pattern named 'Internal Product ID' was deactivated successfully
