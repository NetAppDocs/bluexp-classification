Data Sense provides many ways for you to add a custom list of "personal data" that Data Sense will identify in future scans, giving you the full picture about where potentially sensitive data resides in _all_ your organizations' files.

* You can add unique identifiers based on specific columns in databases you are scanning.
* You can add custom keywords from a text file -- these words are identified within your data.
* You can add a personal pattern using a regular expression (regex) -- the regex is added to the existing predefined patterns.

All of these mechanisms to add custom scanning criteria are supported in all languages.

NOTE: The capabilities described in this section are available only if you have chosen to perform a full classification scan on your data sources. Data sources that have had a mapping-only scan do not show file-level details.

== Add custom personal data identifiers from your databases

A feature we call _Data Fusion_ allows you to scan your organizations' data to identify whether unique identifiers from your databases are found in any of your other data sources. You can choose the additional identifiers that Data Sense will look for in its' scans by selecting a specific column, or columns, in a database table. For example, the diagram below shows how data fusion is used to scan your volumes, buckets, and databases for occurrences of all your Customer IDs from your Oracle database.

image:diagram_compliance_data_fusion.png[A diagram showing how content from your databases can be used as a source to identify files that contain the same data.]

As you can see, two unique Customer IDs have been found in two volumes and in one S3 bucket. Any matches in database tables will also be identified.

Note that since you're scanning your own databases, whatever language your data is stored in will be used to identify data in future Data Sense scans.

.Steps

You must have link:task-scanning-databases.html#adding-the-database-server[added at least one database server^] to Data Sense before you can add data fusion sources.

. In the Configuration page, click *Manage Data Fusion* in the database where the source data resides.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_manage_data_fusion.png[A screenshot of selecting the Manage Data Fusion button to add a source column.]

. Click *Add Data Fusion source* on the next page.

. In the _Add Data Fusion Source_ page:
.. Select the Database Schema from the drop-down menu.
.. Enter the Table name in that schema.
.. Enter the Column, or Columns, that contain the unique identifiers you want to use.
+
When adding multiple columns, enter each column name, or table view name, on a separate line.
+

. Click *Add Data Fusion Source*.
+
The Data Fusion inventory page displays the database source columns that you have configured Data Sense to scan.
+

.Results
After the next scan, the results will include this new information in the Compliance Dashboard under the "Personal Results" section, and in the Investigation page in the "Personal Data" filter. Each source column you added appears in the filter list in the format "Table.Column", for example `Customers.CustomerID`.

=== Delete a Data Fusion source

If at some point you decide not to scan your files using a certain Data Fusion source, you can select the source row from the Data Fusion inventory page and click *Delete Data Fusion Source*.

== Add custom keywords from a list of words

You can add custom keywords to Data Sense so that it will identify where that information is found in your data. You add the keywords just by entering each word you want Data Sense to recognize. The keywords are added to the existing predefined keywords that Data Sense already uses, and the results will be visible under the personal patterns section. 

For example, you may want to see where internal Product Names are mentioned in all of your files to make sure these names are not accessible in locations that are not secure.

After updating the custom keywords, Data Sense will restart scanning all data sources. After the scan has completed, the new results will appear in the Data Sense Compliance Dashboard under the "Personal Results" section, and in the Investigation page in the "Personal Data" filter.

.Steps

. From the _Classification settings_ tab, click *Add New Classifier* to launch the _Add Custom Classifier_ wizard.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_classifier_button.png[A screenshot showing how to launch the Add Custom Classifier wizard.]

. In the _Select type_ page, enter the name of the classifier, provide a brief description, select *Personal identifier*, and then click *Next*.
+
The name you enter will appear in the Data Sense UI as the heading for scanned files that match the classifier requirements. You can also check the box to "Mask detected results in the system" so the full result won't appear in the UI. For example, you may want to do this to hide full credit card numbers or similar personal data (the mask would appear in the UI like this: "3434 pass:[****] pass:[****] pass:[****]").
+
image:screenshot_select_classifier_type2.png[A screenshot showing how to name the classifier and select the type of classifier.]

. In the _Select Data Analysis Tool_ page, select *Custom keywords* as the method you want to use to define the classifier, and then click *Next*.
+
image:screenshot_select_classifier_tool_keywords.png[A screenshot showing the selection of Custom keywords as the tool that Data Sense will use to build the pattern.]

. In the _Create Logic_ page, enter the keywords you want to recognize - each word on a separate line - and click *Validate*.
+
The screenshot below shows internal Product Names (different types of owls). The Data Sense search for these items is not case sensitive.
+
image:screenshot_select_classifier_create_logic_keyword.png[A screenshot of entering the keywords for your customer classifier.]

. Click *Done* and Data Sense starts to rescan your data.

.Results
After the scan is complete, the results will include this new information in the Compliance Dashboard under the "Personal Results" section, and in the Investigation page in the "Personal Data" filter.

image:screenshot_add_keywords_result.png[A screenshot showing an example of custom keyword results in the Investigation Results pane.]

As you can see, the name of the classifier is used as the name in the Personal Results panel. In this manner you can activate many different groups of keywords and see the results for each group.

== Add custom personal data identifiers using a regex

You can add a personal pattern to identify specific information in your data using a custom regular expression (regex). This allows you to create a new custom regex to identify new personal information elements that don't yet exist in the system. The regex is added to the existing predefined patterns that Data Sense already uses, and the results will be visible under the personal patterns section. 

For example, you may want to see where your internal Product IDs are mentioned in all of your files. If the Product ID has a clear structure, for example, it is a 12-digit number that starts with 201, you can use the custom regex feature to search for it in your files. The regular expression for this example is *\b201\d{9}\b*.

After adding the regex, Data Sense will restart scanning all data sources. After the scan has completed, the new results will appear in the Data Sense Compliance Dashboard under the "Personal Results" section, and in the Investigation page in the "Personal Data" filter.

.Steps

. From the _Classification settings_ tab, click *Add New Classifier* to launch the _Add Custom Classifier_ wizard.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_classifier_button.png[A screenshot showing how to launch the Add Custom Classifier wizard.]

. In the _Select type_ page, enter the name of the classifier, provide a brief description, select *Personal identifier*, and then click *Next*.
+
The name you enter will appear in the Data Sense UI as the heading for scanned files that match the classifier requirements. You can also check the box to "Mask detected results in the system" so the full result won't appear in the UI. For example, you may want to do this to hide full credit card numbers or similar personal data.
+
image:screenshot_select_classifier_type.png[A screenshot showing how to name the classifier and select the type of classifier.]

. In the _Select Data Analysis Tool_ page, select *Custom regular expression* as the method you want to use to define the classifier, and then click *Next*.
+
image:screenshot_select_classifier_tool_regex.png[A screenshot showing the selection of Custom regular expression as the tool that Data Sense will use to build the pattern.]

. In the _Create Logic_ page, enter the regular expression and any proximity words, and click *Done*.
+
.. You can enter any legal regular expression. Click the *Validate* button to have Data Sense verify that the regular expression is valid, and that it is not too broad -- meaning it will return too many results.
.. Optionally, you can enter some proximity words to help refine the accuracy of the results. These are words that will typically be found within 300 characters of the pattern you are searching for (either before or after the found pattern). Enter each word, or phrase, on a separate line.
+

.Result

The classifier is added and Data Sense starts to rescan all your data sources. You are returned to the Custom Classifiers page where you can view the number of files that have matched your new classifier. Results from scanning all of your data sources will take some time depending on the number of files that need to be scanned.

Click the image:button_arrow_investigate.png[circle with an arrow] button to see the detailed results in the Investigation page.

Additionally, all of your custom classifier results appear in the Custom Classifiers tab, and the top 6 custom classifier results are displayed in the Compliance Dashboard, as shown below.

image:screenshot_custom_classifier_top_5.png[A screenshot showing the top 3 custom classifiers based on returned results.]

== Manage custom classifiers

You can change any of the custom classifiers that you have created by using the *Edit Classifier* button.

And if you decide at some later point that you don't need Data Sense to identify the custom patterns that you added, you can use the *Delete Classifier* button to remove each item.
