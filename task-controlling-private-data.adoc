Gain control of your private data by viewing details about the personal data (PII) and sensitive personal data (SPII) in your organization. You can also gain visibility by reviewing the categories and file types that BlueXP classification found in your data.

NOTE: The capabilities described in this section are available only if you have chosen to perform a full classification scan on your data sources. Data sources that have had a mapping-only scan do not show file-level details.

By default, the BlueXP classification dashboard displays compliance data for all working environments and databases. To see data for only some of the working environments, select them.

Filter the results from the Data Investigation page and download a report of the results as a CSV file. See link:task-investigate-data.html[Filtering data in the Data Investigation page] for details.

== View files that contain personal data

BlueXP classification automatically identifies specific words, strings, and patterns (Regex) inside the data. For example, Personal Identification Information (PII), credit card numbers, social security numbers, bank account numbers, passwords, and more. link:reference-private-data-categories.html[See the full list]. BlueXP classification identifies this type of information in individual files, in files within directories (shares and folders), and in database tables.

You can also create custom search terms to identify personal data specific to your organization. For more information, see link:task-custom-classification.html[Create a custom classification].

For some types of personal data, BlueXP classification uses _proximity validation_ to validate its findings. The validation occurs by looking for one or more predefined keywords in proximity to the personal data that was found. For example, BlueXP classification identifies a U.S. social security number (SSN) as an SSN if it sees a proximity word next to it--for example, _SSN_ or _social security_. link:reference-private-data-categories.html[The table of personal data] shows when BlueXP classification uses proximity validation.

== View files that contain sensitive personal data

BlueXP classification automatically identifies special types of sensitive personal information, as defined by privacy regulations such as https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN#d1e2051-1-1[articles 9 and 10 of the GDPR^]. For example, information regarding a person's health, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation. link:reference-private-data-categories.html[See the full list]. BlueXP classification identifies this type of information in individual files, in files within directories (shares and folders), and in database tables.

BlueXP classification uses artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and cognitive computing (CC) to understand the meaning of the content that it scans in order to extract entities and categorize it accordingly.

For example, one sensitive GDPR data category is ethnic origin. Because of its NLP abilities, BlueXP classification can distinguish the difference between a sentence that reads "George is Mexican" (indicating sensitive data as specified in article 9 of the GDPR), versus "George is eating Mexican food."

NOTE: Only English is supported when scanning for sensitive personal data. Support for more languages will be added later.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP classification menu, select *Compliance*.

. To investigate the details for all sensitive personal data, select the icon next to the sensitive personal data percentage.

. Investigate the data by searching, sorting, expanding details for a specific file, clicking *Investigate Results* to see masked information, or by downloading the file list.

== View files by categories

BlueXP classification takes the data that it scanned and divides it into different types of categories. Categories are topics based on AI analysis of the content and metadata of each file. link:reference-private-data-categories.html[See the list of categories].

Categories can help you understand what's happening with your data by showing you the types of information that you have. For example, a category like resumes or employee contracts can include sensitive data. When you investigate the results, you might find that employee contracts are stored in a nonsecure location. You can then correct that issue.

NOTE: English, German, and Spanish are supported for categories. Support for more languages will be added later.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP classification menu, select the *Compliance* tab.

. Select the *Investigate Results* arrow icon for one of the top 4 categories directly from the main screen, or select *View All* and then select the icon for any of the categories.

== View files by file types

BlueXP classification takes the data that it scanned and breaks it down by file type. Reviewing your file types can help you control your sensitive data because you might find that certain file types are not stored correctly. link:reference-private-data-categories.html[See the list of file types].

For example, you might be storing CAD files that include very sensitive information about your organization. If they are unsecured, you can take control of the sensitive data by restricting permissions or moving the files to another location.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP classification memu, select the *Compliance* tab.

. Select the *Investigate Results* arrow icon for one of the top 4 file types directly from the main screen, or select *View All* and then select the icon for any of the file types.
