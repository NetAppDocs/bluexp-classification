//If you need to, you can stop BlueXP classification from scanning one or more working environments, databases, file share groups, OneDrive accounts, Google Drive accounts, or SharePoint accounts.

Charging for scanning the data is stopped when the data source is removed.

== Deactivating compliance scans for a working environment

When you deactivate scans, BlueXP classification no longer scans the data on the working environment and it removes the indexed compliance insights from the BlueXP classification instance (the data from the working environment itself isn't deleted).

. From the _Configuration_ page, click the image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More button] button in the row for the working environment, and then click *Deactivate Data Sense*.
