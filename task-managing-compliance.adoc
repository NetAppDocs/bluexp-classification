== Deactivate compliance scans for a working environment

When you deactivate scans, BlueXP classification no longer scans the data on the working environment and it removes the indexed compliance insights from the BlueXP classification instance (the data from the working environment itself isn't deleted).

. From the _Configuration_ page, select the image:button-gallery-options.gif[More button] button in the row for the working environment then *Deactivate Data Sense*.

TIP: You can also disable compliance scans for a working environment from the Services panel when you select the working environment.

. From the _Configuration_ page, select the image:button-gallery-options.gif[More button] button in the row for the database then *Remove DB Server*.
