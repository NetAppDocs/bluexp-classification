Complete a few steps to start scanning your database schemas with BlueXP classification.


== Review prerequisites

Review the following prerequisites to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you enable BlueXP classification.

=== Supported databases

BlueXP classification can scan schemas from the following databases:

* Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)
* MongoDB
* MySQL
* Oracle
* PostgreSQL
* SAP HANA
* SQL Server (MSSQL)

CAUTION: The statistics gathering feature *must be enabled* in the database.

=== Database requirements

Any database with connectivity to the BlueXP classification instance can be scanned, regardless of where it is hosted. You just need the following information to connect to the database:

* IP Address or host name
* Port
* Service name (only for accessing Oracle databases)
* Credentials that allow read access to the schemas
+
When choosing a user name and password, it's important to choose one that has full read permissions to all the schemas and tables you want to scan. We recommend that you create a dedicated user for the BlueXP classification system with all the required permissions.

*Note:* For MongoDB, a read-only Admin role is required.

== Deploy the BlueXP classification instance

Deploy BlueXP classification if there isn't already an instance deployed.

If you are scanning database schemas that are accessible over the internet, you can link:task-deploy-cloud-compliance.html[deploy BlueXP classification in the cloud^] or link:task-deploy-compliance-onprem.html[deploy BlueXP classification in an on-premises location that has internet access^].

If you are scanning database schemas that have been installed in a dark site that has no internet access, you need to link:task-deploy-compliance-dark-site.html[deploy BlueXP classification in the same on-premises location that has no internet access^]. This also requires that the BlueXP Connector is deployed in that same on-premises location.



== Add the database server

Add the database server where the schemas reside.

. From the BlueXP classification menu, select *Configuration*. 

. From the Configuration page, select *Add Working Environment* > *Add Database Server*.

. Enter the required information to identify the database server.
.. Select the database type.
.. Enter the port and the host name or IP address to connect to the database.
.. For Oracle databases, enter the Service name.
.. Enter the credentials so that BlueXP classification can access the server.
.. Click *Add DB Server*.

The database is added to the list of working environments.

== Enable and disable compliance scans on database schemas

You can stop or start full scanning of your schemas at any time.

TIP: There is no option to select mapping-only scans for database schemas.

. From the Configuration page, select the *Configuration* button for the database you want to configure.

. Select the schemas that you want to scan by moving the slider to the right.

.Result

BlueXP classification starts scanning the database schemas that you enabled. You can track the progress of the initial scan by navigating to the **Configuration** menu then selecting the **Working Environment configuration**. The progress of each scan is show as a progress bar. You can also hover over the progress bar to see the number of files scanned relative to the total files in the volume. If there are any errors, they'll appear in the Status column, alongside the required action to fix the error. 

BlueXP classification scans your databases once per day; databases are not continuously scanned like other data sources.
