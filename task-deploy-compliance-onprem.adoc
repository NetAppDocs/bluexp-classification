Complete a few steps to install BlueXP classification on a Linux host in your network, or on a Linux host in the cloud, that has internet access. You'll need to deploy the Linux host manually in your network or in the cloud as part of this installation.

The on-prem installation may be a good option if you prefer to scan on-premises ONTAP systems using a BlueXP classification instance that's also located on premises -- but this is not a requirement. The software functions exactly the same way regardless of which installation method you choose.

The BlueXP classification installation script starts by checking if the system and environment meet the required prerequisites. If the prerequisites are all met, then the installation starts. If you would like to verify the prerequisites independently of running the BlueXP classification installation, there is a separate software package you can download that only tests for the prerequisites. link:task-test-linux-system.html[See how to check if your Linux host is ready to install BlueXP classification].

The typical installation on a Linux host _in your premises_ has the following components and connections.

The typical installation on a Linux host _in the cloud_ has the following components and connections.

image:diagram_deploy_onprem_cloud_instance.png[A diagram of the required BlueXP and network components, and the related connections.]

For very large configurations where you'll be scanning petabytes of data, on versions 1.30 and earlier, you can include multiple hosts to provide additional processing power. When using multiple host systems, the primary system is called the _Manager node_, and the additional systems that provide extra processing power are called _Scanner nodes_.

NOTE: For legacy versions 1.30 and earlier, if you need to install BlueXP classification on multiple hosts, refer to link:task-deploy-multi-host-install-dark-site.html[Install BlueXP classification on multiple hosts with no internet access].


You can also link:task-deploy-compliance-dark-site.html[install BlueXP classification in an on-premises site that doesn't have internet access] for completely secure sites.


NOTE: For legacy versions 1.30 and earlier, to add scanner nodes, refer to link:task-deploy-add-scanner-nodes.html[Add scanner nodes to an existing deployment].

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps, or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-1.png[One] Create a Connector

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you don't already have a Connector, https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-on-prem.html[deploy the Connector on-premises^] on a Linux host in your network, or on a Linux host in the cloud.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can also create a Connector with your cloud provider. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-aws.html[creating a Connector in AWS^], https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-azure.html[creating a Connector in Azure^], or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-google.html[creating a Connector in GCP^].

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Review prerequisites

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Ensure that your environment can meet the prerequisites. This includes outbound internet access for the instance, connectivity between the Connector and BlueXP classification over port 443, and more. <<Enable outbound internet access from BlueXP classification,See the complete list>>.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You also need a Linux system that meets the <<Prepare the Linux host system,following requirements>>.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Download and deploy BlueXP classification

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Download the Cloud BlueXP classification software from the NetApp Support Site and copy the installer file to the Linux host you plan to use. Then launch the installation wizard and follow the prompts to deploy the BlueXP classification instance.


== Create a Connector

A BlueXP Connector is required before you can install and use BlueXP classification. In most cases you'll probably have a Connector set up before you attempt to activate BlueXP classification because most https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[BlueXP features require a Connector], but there are cases where you'll you need to set one up now.
 
To create one in your cloud provider environment, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-aws.html[creating a Connector in AWS^], https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-azure.html[creating a Connector in Azure^], or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-google.html[creating a Connector in GCP^]. 

There are some scenarios where you have to use a Connector that's deployed in a specific cloud provider:

* When scanning data in Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS or Amazon FSx for ONTAP, you use a Connector in AWS.
* When scanning data in Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure or in Azure NetApp Files, you use a Connector in Azure.
+
For Azure NetApp Files, it must be deployed in the same region as the volumes you wish to scan.
* When scanning data in Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP, you use a Connector in GCP.

On-prem ONTAP systems, NetApp file shares and database accounts can be scanned using any of these cloud Connectors.

Note that you can also https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-on-prem.html[deploy the Connector on-premises^] on a Linux host in your network or on a Linux host in the cloud. Some users planning to install BlueXP classification on-prem may also choose to install the Connector on-prem.

//As you can see, there may be some situations where you need to use https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[multiple Connectors].

You'll need the IP address or host name of the Connector system when installing BlueXP classification. You'll have this information if you installed the Connector in your premises. If the Connector is deployed in the cloud, you can find this information from the BlueXP console: click the Help icon, select *Support*, and click *BlueXP Connector*.

== Prepare the Linux host system

BlueXP classification software must run on a host that meets specific operating system requirements, RAM requirements, software requirements, and so on. The Linux host can be in your network, or in the cloud. 

Ensure that you can keep BlueXP classification running. The BlueXP classification machine needs to stay on to continuously scan your data.

include::_include/host-requirements.adoc[]

* *Firewalld considerations*: If you are planning to use `firewalld`, we recommend that you enable it before installing BlueXP classification. Run the following commands to configure `firewalld` so that it is compatible with BlueXP classification:
+
 firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
 firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
 firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
 firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
 firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
 firewall-cmd --reload
+
If you're planning to use additional BlueXP classification hosts as scanner nodes, add these rules to your primary system at this time:
+
 firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=2377/tcp
 firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=7946/udp
 firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=7946/tcp
 firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=4789/udp
+
Note that you must restart Docker or Podman whenever you enable or update `firewalld` settings.
// or Podman

NOTE: The IP address of the BlueXP classification host system can't be changed after installation.

== Enable outbound internet access from BlueXP classification

BlueXP classification requires outbound internet access. If your virtual or physical network uses a proxy server for internet access, ensure that the BlueXP classification instance has outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints.

[cols="43,57",options="header"]

//Ensure that the BlueXP Connector has the required permissions::
//Ensure that the Connector has permissions to deploy resources and create security groups for the BlueXP classification instance. You can find the latest BlueXP permissions in https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-permissions.html[the policies provided by NetApp^].
//
//Ensure web browser connectivity to BlueXP classification::
//After BlueXP classification is enabled, ensure that users access the BlueXP interface from a host that has a connection to the BlueXP classification instance.
//+
//The BlueXP classification instance uses a private IP address to ensure that the indexed data isn't accessible to the internet. As a result, the web browser that you use to access BlueXP must have a connection to that private IP address. That connection can come from a direct connection to your cloud provider (for example, a VPN), or from a host that's inside the same network as the BlueXP classification instance.

== Verify that all required ports are enabled

You must ensure that all required ports are open for communication between the Connector, BlueXP classification, Active Directory, and your data sources.

[cols="25,25,50",options="header"]
|===
| Connection Type
| Ports
| Description

|Connector <> BlueXP classification | 8080 (TCP), 443 (TCP), and 80. 9000 | The firewall or routing rules for the Connector must allow inbound and outbound traffic over port 443 to and from the BlueXP classification instance.

Make sure port 8080 is open so you can see the installation progress in BlueXP.

If a firewall is used on the Linux host, port 9000 is required for internal processes within an Ubuntu server.

|Connector <> ONTAP cluster (NAS) | 443 (TCP)  a| BlueXP discovers ONTAP clusters using HTTPS. If you use custom firewall policies, they must meet the following requirements:

* The Connector host must allow outbound HTTPS access through port 443. If the Connector is in the cloud, all outbound communication is allowed by the predefined firewall or routing rules.
* The ONTAP cluster must allow inbound HTTPS access through port 443. The default "mgmt" firewall policy allows inbound HTTPS access from all IP addresses. If you modified this default policy, or if you created your own firewall policy, you must associate the HTTPS protocol with that policy and enable access from the Connector host.
|BlueXP classification <> ONTAP cluster  a| * For NFS - 111 (TCP\UDP) and 2049 (TCP\UDP)
* For CIFS - 139 (TCP\UDP) and 445 (TCP\UDP) a| BlueXP classification needs a network connection to each Cloud Volumes ONTAP subnet or on-prem ONTAP system. Firewalls or routing rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP must allow inbound connections from the BlueXP classification instance. 

Make sure these ports are open to the BlueXP classification instance:

* For NFS - 111 and 2049
* For CIFS - 139 and 445

NFS volume export policies must allow access from the BlueXP classification instance.
|BlueXP classification <> Active Directory | 389 (TCP & UDP), 636 (TCP), 3268 (TCP), and 3269 (TCP) a| You must have an Active Directory already set up for the users in your company. Additionally, BlueXP classification needs Active Directory credentials to scan CIFS volumes.

You must have the information for the Active Directory:

* DNS Server IP Address, or multiple IP Addresses
* User Name and Password for the server
* Domain Name (Active Directory Name)
* Whether you are using secure LDAP (LDAPS) or not
* LDAP Server Port (typically 389 for LDAP, and 636 for secure LDAP)

//If you are using multiple BlueXP classification hosts to provide additional processing power to scan your data sources, you'll need to enable additional ports/protocols. link:task-deploy-compliance-onprem.html[See the additional port requirements].

== Install BlueXP classification on the Linux host

For typical configurations you'll install the software on a single host system. <<Single-host installation for typical configurations,See those steps here>>.

image:diagram_deploy_onprem_single_host_internet.png[A diagram showing the location of the data sources you can scan when using a single BlueXP classification instance deployed on-prem with internet access.]

For very large configurations where you'll be scanning petabytes of data, you can include multiple hosts to provide additional processing power. Learn more link:task-deploy-multi-host-install-dark-site.html> about installing on multiple hosts for large configurations. 

image:diagram_deploy_onprem_multi_host_internet.png[A diagram showing the location of the data sources you can scan when using multiple BlueXP classification instances deployed on-prem with internet access.]

See <<Prepare the Linux host system,Preparing the Linux host system>> and <<Enable outbound internet access from BlueXP classification,Reviewing prerequisites>> for the full list of requirements before you deploy BlueXP classification.

Upgrades to BlueXP classification software is automated as long as the instance has internet connectivity.

NOTE: BlueXP classification is currently unable to scan S3 buckets, Azure NetApp Files, or FSx for ONTAP when the software is installed on premises. In these cases you'll need to deploy a separate Connector and instance of BlueXP classification in the cloud and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[switch between Connectors^] for your different data sources.

=== Single-host installation for typical configurations

Review the requirements and follow these steps when installing BlueXP classification software on a single on-premises host.

https://youtu.be/rFpmekdbORc[Watch this video^] to see how to install BlueXP classification.

Note that all installation activities are logged when installing BlueXP classification. If you run into any issues during installation, you can view the contents of the installation audit log. It is written to `/opt/netapp/install_logs/`. link:task-audit-data-sense-actions.html[See more details here].

.What you'll need

* Verify that your Linux system meets the <<Prepare the Linux host system,host requirements>>.
* Verify that the system has the two prerequisite software packages installed (Docker Engine or Podman, and Python 3).
//add 'or Podman' in 2nd bullet
* Make sure you have root privileges on the Linux system.
* If you're using a proxy for access to the internet:
** You'll need the proxy server information (IP address or host name, connection port, connection scheme: https or http, user name and password).
** If the proxy is performing TLS interception, you'll need to know the path on the BlueXP classification Linux system where the TLS CA certificates are stored.
** The proxy must be non-transparent - we don't currently support transparent proxies.
** The user must be a local user. Domain users are not supported.
* Verify that your offline environment meets the required <<Enable outbound internet access from BlueXP classification,permissions and connectivity>>.

.Steps

. Download the BlueXP classification software from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-data-sense/downloads-tab/[NetApp Support Site^]. The file you should select is named *DATASENSE-INSTALLER-<version>.tar.gz*.

. Copy the installer file to the Linux host you plan to use (using `scp` or some other method).

. Unzip the installer file on the host machine, for example:
+
[source,cli]
tar -xzf DATASENSE-INSTALLER-V1.25.0.tar.gz

. In BlueXP, select *Governance > Classification*.

. Click *Activate Data Sense*.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_compliance_deploy_start.png[A screenshot of selecting the button to activate BlueXP classification.]

. Depending on whether you are installing BlueXP classification on an instance you prepared in the cloud or on an instance you prepared in your premises, click the appropriate *Deploy* button to start the BlueXP classification installation.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_compliance_deploy_onprem.png[A screenshot of selecting the button to deploy BlueXP classification on a machine in the cloud or in your premises.]

. The _Deploy Data Sense On Premises_ dialog is displayed. Copy the provided command (for example: `sudo ./install.sh -a 12345 -c 27AG75 -t 2198qq`) and paste it in a text file so you can use it later. Then click *Close* to dismiss the dialog.

. On the host machine, enter the command you copied and then follow a series of prompts, or you can provide the full command including all required parameters as command line arguments.

+
Note that the installer performs a pre-check to make sure your system and networking requirements are in place for a successful installation. https://youtu.be/_RCYpuLXiV0[Watch this video^] to understand the pre-check messages and implications.
