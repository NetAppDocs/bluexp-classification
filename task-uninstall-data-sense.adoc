You can uninstall BlueXP classification to troubleshoot issues or to permanently remove the software from the host. Deleting the instance also deletes the associated disks where the indexed data resides, meaning all the information BlueXP classification has scanned will be permanently deleted.

The steps that you need to use depend on whether you deployed BlueXP classification in the cloud or on an on-premises host.

. In the _Uninstall Classification_ dialog, type *uninstall* to confirm that you want to disconnect the BlueXP classification instance from the BlueXP Connector then select *Uninstall*.

. Go to your cloud provider's console and delete the BlueXP classification instance. The instance is named _CloudCompliance_ with a generated hash (UUID) concatenated to it. For example: _CloudCompliance-16bb6564-38ad-4080-9a92-36f5fd2f71c7_

The script is located in the `/install/light_probe/onprem_installer/cleanup.sh` directory.
