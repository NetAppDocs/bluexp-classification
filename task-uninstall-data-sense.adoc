You can uninstall the Data Sense software to troubleshoot issues or to permanently remove the software from the host. Deleting the instance also deletes the associated disks where the indexed data resides - all the information Data Sense has scanned will be permanently deleted.

The steps that you need to use depend on whether you deployed Data Sense in the cloud or on an on-premises host.

== Uninstall Data Sense from a cloud deployment

You can uninstall and delete the Cloud Data Sense instance from the cloud provider if you no longer want to use Data Sense.

. In the _Uninstall Data Sense_ dialog, type *uninstall* to confirm that you want to delete the instance and all associated data, and then click *Uninstall*.

Note that you can go to your cloud provider's console and delete the Cloud Data Sense instance from there as well. The instance is named _CloudCompliance_ with a generated hash (UUID) concatenated to it. For example: _CloudCompliance-16bb6564-38ad-4080-9a92-36f5fd2f71c7_
