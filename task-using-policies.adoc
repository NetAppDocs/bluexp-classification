Policies are like a favorites list of custom filters that provide search results in the Investigation page for commonly requested compliance queries. BlueXP classification provides a set of predefined policies based on common customer requests. You can create custom policies that provide results for searches specific to your organization.

Policies provide the following functionality:

* <<List of predefined policies,Predefined policies>> from NetApp based on user requests
* Ability to create your own custom policies
* Launch the Investigation page with the results from your Policies in one click
//* Send email alerts to BlueXP users, or any other email addresses, when certain critical Policies return results so you can get notifications to protect your data
//* Assign AIP (Azure Information Protection) labels automatically to all files that match the criteria defined in a Policy
//* Delete files automatically (once per day) when certain Policies return results so you can protect your data automatically

The *Policies* tab in the Compliance Dashboard lists all the predefined and custom policies available on this instance of BlueXP classification.

Policies also appear in the list of filters in the Investigation page.
