=== Current restrictions

The following BlueXP classification features are not currently supported with Google Drive files:

* When viewing files in the Data Investigation page, the actions in the button bar aren't active. You can't copy, move, delete, etc. any files.
* Permissions can't be identified within files in Google Drive, so no permission information is displayed in the Investigation page.

== Deploy BlueXP classification

Deploy BlueXP classification if there isn't already an instance deployed.

BlueXP classification can be link:task-deploy-cloud-compliance.html[deployed in the cloud^] or link:task-deploy-compliance-onprem.html[in an on-premises location that has internet access^].

Upgrades to BlueXP classification software is automated as long as the instance has internet connectivity.
//
// BlueXP classification can also be link:task-deploy-compliance-dark-site.html[deployed in an on-premises location that has no internet access^]. However, you'll need to provide internet access to a few select endpoints to scan your local Google Drive files. link:task-deploy-compliance-dark-site.html[See the list of required endpoints here].

== Remove a Google Drive account from compliance scans

//If you remove a Google Drive site in the future, or decide not to scan files in a Google Drive site, you can remove individual Google Drive sites from having their files scanned at any time. Just click *Remove Google Drive Site* from the Configuration page.
//
//image:screenshot_compliance_sharepoint_remove_site.png[A screenshot showing how to remove a single Google Drive site from having their files scanned.]
Since only a single user's Google Drive files are part of a single Google Drive account, if you want to stop scanning files from a user's Google Drive account, then you should link:task-managing-compliance.html[delete the Google Drive account from BlueXP classification].
