Complete a few steps to get started scanning Amazon FSx for ONTAP volume with BlueXP classification.

== Before you begin

* You need an active Connector in AWS to deploy and manage BlueXP classification.

* The security group you selected when creating the working environment must allow traffic from the BlueXP classification instance. You can find the associated security group using the ENI connected to the FSx for ONTAP file system and edit it using the AWS Management Console.

Now that BlueXP classification is enabled, ensure that it can access all volumes.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* The BlueXP classification instance needs a network connection to each FSx for ONTAP subnet.
* Make sure the following ports are open to the BlueXP classification instance:
** For NFS – ports 111 and 2049.
** For CIFS – ports 139 and 445.
* NFS volume export policies must allow access from the BlueXP classification instance.
* BlueXP classification needs Active Directory credentials to scan CIFS volumes.
 +
Click *Compliance* > *Configuration* > *Edit CIFS Credentials* and provide the credentials.

Select or deselect the volumes you want to scan and BlueXP classification will start or stop scanning them.

== Discover the FSx for ONTAP file system that you want to scan

If the FSx for ONTAP file system you want to scan is not already in BlueXP as a working environment, you can add it to the canvas at this time.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-fsx-ontap/use/task-creating-fsx-working-environment.html[See how to discover or create the FSx for ONTAP file system in BlueXP^].

== Deploy the BlueXP classification instance

link:task-deploy-cloud-compliance.html[Deploy BlueXP classification^] if there isn't already an instance deployed.

You should deploy BlueXP classification in the same AWS network as the Connector for AWS and the FSx volumes you wish to scan.

*Note:* Deploying BlueXP classification in an on-premises location is not currently supported when scanning FSx volumes.

Upgrades to BlueXP classification software is automated as long as the instance has internet connectivity.

== Enable BlueXP classification in your working environments

You can enable BlueXP classification for FSx for ONTAP volumes.

. From the BlueXP left navigation menu, click *Governance > Classification* and then select the *Configuration* tab.
+
image:screenshot_fsx_scanning_activate.png[A screenshot of the Configuration tab immediately after deploying the BlueXP classification instance.]

. Select how you want to scan the volumes in each working environment. link:concept-cloud-compliance.html#whats-the-difference-between-mapping-and-classification-scans[Learn about mapping and classification scans]:

* To map all volumes, click *Map all Volumes*.
* To map and classify all volumes, click *Map & Classify all Volumes*.
* To customize scanning for each volume, click *Or select scanning type for each volume*, and then choose the volumes you want to map and/or classify.
+
See <<Enable and disable compliance scans on volumes,Enabling and disabling compliance scans on volumes>> for details.

. In the confirmation dialog box, click *Approve* to have BlueXP classification start scanning your volumes.

.Result

BlueXP classification starts scanning the volumes you selected in the working environment. Results will be available in the Compliance dashboard as soon as BlueXP classification finishes the initial scans. The time that it takes depends on the amount of data--it could be a few minutes or hours.

[NOTE]
====
* By default, if BlueXP classification doesn't have write attributes permissions in CIFS, or write permissions in NFS, the system won't scan the files in your volumes because BlueXP classification can't revert the "last access time" to the original timestamp. If you don't care if the last access time is reset, click *Or select scanning type for each volume*. The resulting page has a setting you can enable so that BlueXP classification will scan the volumes regardless of permissions.
* BlueXP classification scans only one file share under a volume. If you have multiple shares in your volumes, you'll need to scan those other shares separately as a shares group. link:reference-limitations.html#bluexp-classification-scans-only-one-share-under-a-volume[See more details about this BlueXP classification limitation^].
====

== Verify that BlueXP classification has access to volumes

Make sure BlueXP classification can access volumes by checking your networking, security groups, and export policies.

You'll need to provide BlueXP classification with CIFS credentials so it can access CIFS volumes.

.Steps

. On the _Configuration_ page, click *View Details* to review the status and correct any errors.
+
For example, the following image shows a volume BlueXP classification can't scan due to network connectivity issues between the BlueXP classification instance and the volume.
+
image:screenshot_fsx_scanning_no_network_error.png["A screenshot of the View Details page in the scan configuration showing volume not being scanned because of network connectivity between BlueXP classification and the volume."]

. Make sure there's a network connection between the BlueXP classification instance and each network that includes volumes for FSx for ONTAP.
+
NOTE: For FSx for ONTAP, BlueXP classification can scan volumes only in the same region as BlueXP.

. Ensure the following ports are open to the BlueXP classification instance.
** For NFS – ports 111 and 2049.
** For CIFS – ports 139 and 445.

. Ensure NFS volume export policies include the IP address of the BlueXP classification instance so it can access the data on each volume.

. If you use CIFS, provide BlueXP classification with Active Directory credentials so it can scan CIFS volumes.

.. From the BlueXP left navigation menu, click *Governance > Classification* and then select the *Configuration* tab.

.. For each working environment, click *Edit CIFS Credentials* and enter the user name and password that BlueXP classification needs to access CIFS volumes on the system.
+
The credentials can be read-only, but providing admin credentials ensures that BlueXP classification can read any data that requires elevated permissions. The credentials are stored on the BlueXP classification instance.
include::_include/cifs-permissions.adoc[]
+
After you enter the credentials, you should see a message that all CIFS volumes were authenticated successfully.

== Enable and disable compliance scans on volumes

You can start or stop mapping-only scans, or mapping and classification scans, in a working environment at any time from the Configuration page. You can also change from mapping-only scans to mapping and classification scans, and vice-versa. We recommend that you scan all volumes.

The switch at the top of the page for *Scan when missing "write attributes" permissions* is disabled by default. This means that if BlueXP classification doesn't have write attributes permissions in CIFS, or write permissions in NFS, that the system won't scan the files because BlueXP classification can't revert the "last access time" to the original timestamp. If you don't care if the last access time is reset, turn the switch ON and all files are scanned regardless of the permissions. link:reference-collected-metadata.html#last-access-time-timestamp[Learn more^].

[cols="45,45",width=90%,options="header"]
|===
| To:
| Do this:

| Enable mapping-only scans on a volume | In the volume area, click *Map*
| Enable full scanning on a volume | In the volume area, click *Map & Classify*
| Disable scanning on a volume | In the volume area, click *Off*
| |
| Enable mapping-only scans on all volumes | In the heading area, click *Map*
| Enable full scanning on all volumes | In the heading area, click *Map & Classify*
| Disable scanning on all volumes | In the heading area, click *Off*

|===

NOTE: New volumes added to the working environment are automatically scanned only when you have set the *Map* or *Map & Classify* setting in the heading area. When set to *Custom* or *Off* in the heading area, you'll need to activate mapping and/or full scanning on each new volume you add in the working environment.

== Scan data protection volumes

By default, data protection (DP) volumes are not scanned because they are not exposed externally and BlueXP classification cannot access them. These are the destination volumes for SnapMirror operations from an FSx for ONTAP file system.

Initially, the volume list identifies these volumes as _Type_ *DP* with the _Status_ *Not Scanning* and the _Required Action_ *Enable Access to DP volumes*.

image:screenshot_cloud_compliance_dp_volumes.png[A screenshot showing the Enable Access to DP Volumes button that you can select to scan data protection volumes.]

.Steps

If you want to scan these data protection volumes:

. Click *Enable Access to DP volumes* at the top of the page.

. Review the confirmation message and click *Enable Access to DP volumes* again.
- Volumes that were initially created as NFS volumes in the source FSx for ONTAP file system are enabled.
- Volumes that were initially created as CIFS volumes in the source FSx for ONTAP file system require that you enter CIFS credentials to scan those DP volumes. If you already entered Active Directory credentials so that BlueXP classification can scan CIFS volumes you can use those credentials, or you can specify a different set of Admin credentials.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_dp_cifs_volumes.png[A screenshot of the two options for enabling CIFS data protection volumes.]

. Activate each DP volume that you want to scan <<Enabling and disabling compliance scans on volumes,the same way you enabled other volumes>>.

.Result
Once enabled, BlueXP classification creates an NFS share from each DP volume that was activated for scanning. The share export policies only allow access from the BlueXP classification instance.

*Note:* If you had no CIFS data protection volumes when you initially enabled access to DP volumes, and later add some, the button *Enable Access to CIFS DP* appears at the top of the Configuration page. Click this button and add CIFS credentials to enable access to these CIFS DP volumes.

NOTE: Active Directory credentials are only registered in the storage VM of the first CIFS DP volume, so all DP volumes on that SVM will be scanned. Any volumes that reside on other SVMs will not have the Active Directory credentials registered, so those DP volumes won't be scanned.
