Complete a few steps to start scanning data within StorageGRID directly with BlueXP classification. 

//Complete a few steps to start scanning data within StorageGRID directly with BlueXP classification. BlueXP classification can scan data from any Object Storage service which uses the Simple Storage Service (S3) protocol. This includes NetApp StorageGRID, IBM Cloud Object Store, Linode, B2 Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, and more.
//Azure Blob (using MinIO),  



== Review StorageGRID requirements

Review the following prerequisites to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you enable BlueXP classification.

* You need to have the endpoint URL to connect with the object storage service.

* You need to have the Access Key and Secret Key from StorageGRID so that BlueXP classification can access the buckets.
//
//* Support for Azure Blob requires that you use the link:https://min.io/[MinIO service^].

== Deploy the BlueXP classification instance

Deploy BlueXP classification if there isn't already an instance deployed.

If you are scanning data from StorageGRID that is accessible over the internet, you can link:task-deploy-cloud-compliance.html[deploy BlueXP classification in the cloud^] or link:task-deploy-compliance-onprem.html[deploy BlueXP classification in an on-premises location that has internet access^].

If you are scanning data from StorageGRID that has been installed in a dark site that has no internet access, you need to link:task-deploy-compliance-dark-site.html[deploy BlueXP classification in the same on-premises location that has no internet access^]. This also requires that the BlueXP Connector is deployed in that same on-premises location.

Upgrades to BlueXP classification software are automated as long as the instance has internet connectivity.

== Add the StorageGRID service to BlueXP classification

Add the StorageGRID service.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP classification menu, select the *Configuration* option. 

. From the Configuration page, select *Add Working Environment* > *Add StorageGRID*.


. In the Add StorageGRID Service dialog, enter the details for the StorageGRID service and click *Continue*.
.. Enter the name you want to use for the Working Environment. This name should reflect the name of the StorageGRID service to which you are connecting.
.. Enter the Endpoint URL to access the object storage service.
.. Enter the Access Key and Secret Key so that BlueXP classification can access the buckets in StorageGRID.

.Result

StorageGRID is added to the list of working environments.

== Enable and disable compliance scans on StorageGRID buckets

After you enable BlueXP classification on StorageGRID, the next step is to configure the buckets that you want to scan. BlueXP classification discovers those buckets and displays them in the working environment you created.

.Steps

. In the Configuration page, locate the StorageGRID working environment. 

. On the StorageGRID working environment tile, select *Configuration*.

. Complete one of the following steps to enable or disable scanning:
+
* To enable mapping-only scans on a bucket, select *Map*. 
* To enable full scans on a bucket, select *Map & Classify*. 
* To disable scanning on a bucket, select *Off*.



.Result

BlueXP classification starts scanning the buckets that you enabled. If there are any errors, they'll appear in the Status column, alongside the required action to fix the error.
