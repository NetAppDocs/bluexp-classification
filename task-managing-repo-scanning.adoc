You can manage how your data is being scanned in each of your working environments and data sources. You can make the changes on a "repository" basis; meaning you can make changes for each volume, bucket, share, schema, user, etc. depending on the type of data source you are scanning.

Some of the things you can change are whether a repository is scanned or not, and whether BlueXP classification is performing a link:concept-cloud-compliance.html#whats-the-difference-between-mapping-and-classification-scans[mapping scan or a mapping & classification scan]. You can also pause and resume scanning, for example, if you need to stop scanning a volume for a period of time.

== View the scan status for your repositories

You can view the individual repositories that BlueXP classification is scanning (volumes, buckets, etc.) for each working environment and data source. Additionally, you can see how many have been "Mapped", and how many have been "Classified". Classification takes a longer time as the full AI identification is being performed on all data.

//You can view the scanning status of each work environment on the Configuration page:
//* Running - green dot
//* Queued - orange dot
//* Paused - gray dot
//* Error - red dot

//After a scan has completed, you can also see the last full cycle date and time.

.Steps

. From the Configuration tab, click the *Configuration* button for the working environment.

. In the Scan Configuration page you can view the scan settings for all repositories.
+

You can hover your cursor over the chart in the _Mapping Status_ column to see the number of files that remain to be mapped or classified in each repository (bucket in this example).

== Change the type of scanning for a repository

You can start or stop mapping-only scans, or mapping and classification scans, in a working environment at any time from the Configuration page. You can also change from mapping-only scans to mapping and classification scans, and vice-versa.

TIP: Databases can't be set to mapping-only scans. Database scanning can be Off or On; where On is equivalent to Map & Classify.

.Steps

. From the Configuration tab, click the *Configuration* button for the working environment.

. In the Scan Configuration page you can change any of the repositories (buckets in this example) to perform *Map* or *Map & Classify* scans.

Certain types of working environments enable you to change the type of scanning globally for all repositories using a button bar at the top of the page. This is valid for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, on-premises ONTAP, Azure NetApp Files, and Amazon FSx for ONTAP systems.

The example below shows this button bar for an Azure NetApp Files system.

== Stop scanning for a repository

You can stop scanning a repository (for example, a volume) if you no longer need to monitor it for compliance. You do this by turning scanning "off". When scanning is turned off, all the indexing and information about that volume is removed from the system, and charging for scanning the data is stopped.

.Steps

. From the Configuration tab, click the *Configuration* button for the working environment.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_config_button.png[A screenshot showing how to click the Configuration button for a working environment.]

. In the Scan Configuration page select *Off* to stop scanning for a particular bucket.

== Pause and resume scanning for a repository

You can "pause" scanning on a repository if you want to temporarily stop scanning certain content. Pausing scanning means that BlueXP classification won't perform any future scans for changes or additions to the repository, but that all the current results will still be displayed in the system. Pausing scanning does not stop charging for the scanned the data because the data still exists.

You can "resume" scanning at any time.

.Steps

. From the Configuration tab, click the *Configuration* button for the working environment.
+

. In the Scan Configuration page, click the Pause button to pause scanning for a volume, or press the Resume button to resume scanning for a volume that had been previously paused.

Note that some data sources provide the Pause and Resume functionality in a menu, as shown below for SharePoint sites.
